## ✨ Why I made this and what it does

It was a beautiful day when I returned from my lecture, having taken many photos of formulas in the classroom, and I wanted to review them on my laptop. However, I realized that:

- If I used a cable to transfer, it was fast, sure, but I had to go to the laptop, navigate to the correct photo folder, and then select the photos. Why couldn't I just select them directly on my phone for a more intuitive experience?
    
- If I chose to send photos via third-party apps like Telegram or WhatsApp, it would be troublesome to send a large number of files, and if I sent photos directly, the quality might be reduced due to compression.
    
- If I uploaded them to Google Drive or OneDrive, it was convenient and the quality was good, but then I had to spend time deleting them afterward, which was very annoying.

That's precisely why I created this app: to quickly transfer files and data between devices in situations like these.

<summary>Allegorical Version</summary>

Once upon a time, in a land where knowledge was likened to precious gems, there lived a scholar named John. John loved to learn, especially the intricate formulas of mathematics and physics. Whenever he attended lectures, John would carefully use his magic mirror (which people called a phone) to record these formulas, for they were as precious as mysterious incantations.

One afternoon, with the golden sun casting its glow, John returned home, eager to re-experience the charms he had just collected on his magical stone table (laptop). But alas, when he pulled out the silver thread (USB cable) to connect the two worlds – his magic mirror and the stone table – John noticed John inconvenience: to view the charms, he had to fumble through the labyrinthine library of the stone table, find the right shelf, and only then could he retrieve each gem. "Why can't I just select them directly from my magic mirror, for a more intuitive and quick process?" John sighed.

Then John thought of the swift messenger pigeons (third-party apps like Telegram, Zalo). They could indeed carry charms far, but if it was a huge collection of charms, these pigeons became slow and troublesome. Worse yet, sometimes the charms were compressed, losing their original luster.

John then tried sending the charms to the wondrous clouds (Google Drive, OneDrive). It was convenient, and the quality of the charms remained intact! But afterwards, John had to expend effort climbing onto the cloud to delete his traces. "How annoying!" John lamented.

In his contemplation, John idea flashed in An's mind like a bolt of lightning. He realized that what he needed was not silver threads, messenger pigeons, or wondrous clouds, but a **Mystical Gateway**. A gateway that would allow charms to travel instantly, intact, between his magic mirror and the magical stone table, without any troublesome intermediaries, and all directly controlled by John from his magic mirror.

And so, John toiled day and night, using his intellect and creativity to create **The App – The Mystical Gateway**. From then on, not only John but everyone in the land could easily exchange precious gems and charms between their worlds with unprecedented speed and convenience.

Fin.
