## [help_outline, teal] Common Troubleshooting
[#] Cannot see other devices: Check WiFi connection, network permissions, disable VPN/network blocking.
[#] Cannot send/receive files: Check memory access permissions, available storage, or try restarting the application.
[#] Pairing error: Ensure both devices have the P2Lan function open and are on the same network.
[#] Chat not working: Check network connection and ensure target device is online.
[#] Clipboard not syncing: Check clipboard access permissions and ensure app is running in foreground.
